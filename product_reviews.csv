6,Good quality product,"Nice phone. We can rely on Samsung than any Chinese company like MI, Redmi, Poco, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc.

Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb.
Not has SAmoled display and you can't expect it in this price.
6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.

But the Charger is of 9V and there is mentioned that it is of 15V.

It did justice with its price. Value for money and trust of Samsung.

If you are willing for it, Go ahead üëç",4

20,Great product,"Using the phone for the last 1 year.

‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

‚Ä¢ Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",5

23,Super!,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage.

And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ...

29,Brilliant,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof üòç
Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5
30,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
31,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5
32,Good choice,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4
33,Worth the money,"*Display is great.... No such phone can provide this type of display like galaxy F12 in this range...

*Battery is mind blowing.... Even after heavy usage.. it gave a backup upto 2 days ...

*Performance is ok.... For normal use no such problems.... But heavy gaming is not mandatory...

41,Horrible,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people.",1

91,Bad quality,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features.
2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing.
3. No hitting issue.


4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use.
5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.

.. . ....NO APP LOCK, NO COMPASS. ......

üß∏ APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN.",2
92,Best in the market!,Very best phone for the price according to lg w30 and w31 model with same specification are costing more for the price it is best and awsome to use very perfect for office use i have stored 62 gb full of data but it doesnot hang till now very awsome for the price and battery stands for 2 days,5
93,Good quality product,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.

Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad .",4
94,Moderate,"Camera is not good as campare to sumsung M20
And m11
Mic receptivity not good
Not good product on this range",2
95,Utterly Disappointed,"Not at all a good phone -
Battery backup is good
Good big display
Good colour output
Good 90 hz refresh rate
Good sound output
Loud and clear speaker
Even headphones output is good due to Dolby feature

But lack of features-
Camera is so average, only daylight pictures are good
Doesn't have screen recording
Call recorder don't work properly / sometimes
Split screen not available
doesn't provide headphones
comes with lots of bundle apps
Fast charge is not so fast as only 15 watt, takes 1 hr 30...

96,Must buy!,"It is a super phone in this price range . It camera is good. Display is good. In first time the battery
Is not in function in after 2 days the battery is very good. In full charge it leads in 2 days . It is good performance and good quality . Display is good . You will buy you'll happy. In this price Samsung galaxy F12 is better than anthor mobiles",5
97,Terrific purchase,Wonderful product... good battery life.... nice display.... fast biometric... over all the product is worldclass but they should improve camera quality...# value for money,5
98,Pretty good,"Camera Average 3/5
Performance Good 4/5
Display 2/5
Display quality is so low not vibrant enough since it is TFT display
Battery mentioned as 6000 mah and lasts for a day of moderate to high use 3.5/5
Overall if you get this around 8.5k which is good for value

Impressive thing is finger print sensor which is extremely fast 5/5",4
99,Wonderful,"After using 4 to 5 days ...
Camera is just OK not disappointed
Battery is super more than 2 day if you are a normal user ...
Display is also good ..
Processor is also good
Over all phone is good in this price range .
You can go for it ....",5
100,Nice,"Pocket friendly but not exactly pocket friendly. Other words it's great value for money but due to 6000mah battery it becomes think like 90s mobile phone. I think we don't need 6000mah battery as any way we are home in this lockdown. Apart from phone thickness everything is just awesome, perfect blend of memory, display and cpu. Awesome display. Samsung you rock always.",3
101,Very Good,Poor camera. No night mode. Nice lock app not supported. Rest is good like performance and battery life. Software experience is great,4
102,Highly recommended,Phone look is awesome best suited for official use ...Firstime#samsung Thank u filpkart for speedy delivery,5
103,Pretty good,"As per this rate its good deal for me.
I like it because i am not heavy user or gamer so i like it.
Display is Little bit not because its not Amoled display.",4
104,Great product,Review based on 2 weeks usage. Good phone overall. Decent camera. Good display. Very good battery backup. Samsung product query support claim gorilla glass but do not explicitly mention on their website.,5
105,Wonderful,Good budget friendly device from Samsung specially packed with that 15 watt charger which makes it far better good in every expect if u are thinking of purchasing a phone for your family go for it without anh hesitation,4
106,Delightful,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality. Volume of the phone is very low. music or videos cannot be enjoyed and we can't here properly if speaker is on during call. Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it.",4
107,Does the job,Display is ok ok..as compare to AMOLED screen.Other things like battery and hardware performance is perfect..4gb Ram and 128 gb is nice combination..Overall phone is good in this budget.,3
108,Excellent,Good and fantastic and very happy and lovely mobile,5
109,Brilliant,"The camera does not perform like a 48 mega pixel. However the rear camera clicks fairly good pictures in good light conditions but the same cannot be said for the front camera. Battery performance is great. Display is not that rich. I have not played games like pubg on it therefore can't give details about gaming performance but for normal usage, it is the best phone available under 10k.",5
110,Great product,"Using the phone for the last 1 year.

‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

‚Ä¢ Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",5
111,Classy product,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.,5

Camera quality is good in this price point.

Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it.",4
113,Super!,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ...

189,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough.

212,Classy product,"Superb Phone......

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

Pros:
1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage
2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.
3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good.

Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK.
The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark. The selfish camera is better.

For the camera just install google camera and then it almost beats Pixel 6a in photo quality.

I had no issues with my unit whatsoever as mentioned by some others earlier.

I am loving the haptic feedback, carrier services and fingerprint scanner on this one. It is just flawless.

After the new update, it is more optimised for day to day tasks...

The main problems are,
Battery,
Camera,
Mobile hanging

It is fast charging mobile but it takes 2:30 hours to charge fully

This is 50mb camera mobile. But not worth for even 13mb.

With fewer apps itself it hanged sometimes.",1

1200,Excellent,"Getting snapdragon 680 processor in this price segment is like a dream come true.
Though, there are comprises with the camera and some features but considering the chip shortage and other problems its not a bad deal.
The performance is nice and most importantly if you are a custom rom lover then this will be the best phone for you among the currently available phones in this price segment.",5
1201,Value-for-money,"The device comes in a very good packaging.
It would've been better if they would've also included a soft case too.
Rear Camera is much better but front is okay.

Altogether will recommend to buy but if you're a camera enthusiast i suggest you stay away.",4
1202,Nice product,"All departments of this device is good except camera.
I think the camera of the phone that comes under 6k to 7k is also much better than this phone's camera. One more downside of this phone is ""charger"". This phone supports 18w charging but just 10w charger is given in the box. Except these two things almost every thing is good in this phone.",4

1204,Decent product,I expected more from this device but when I start using the phone it closes the apps automatically and hanging very much with this processor and camera is don't like 50 mp even the 16 mp is good but when we zoom it work other wise there is difference between 16 mp and 50 mp and the huge disadvantage is the phone inbox charger 10w it take lots of time to charge around 3 hours üò∞üò∞üò∞ my openion is don't buy this product because I generally use this device right now üôèüôèüôè,3

1482,Wonderful,"Writing this review after two-week usage:-

Everything is fine in this phone, you can blindly go for this. I saw many negative comments about this phone but real thing is different.

Camera:- Good you can take Bokeh effect photos clearly.

Performance:- I am a Hardcore Gamer and I say that this phone is a beast in this range. No heating issues, Lags etc. Sometimes in hot temperatures you can face minor framedrops.

No ads.

In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5
1838,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
1839,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5
1840,Good choice,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4

The main problems are,
Battery,
Camera,
Mobile hanging

It is fast charging mobile but it takes 2:30 hours to charge fully

This is 50mb camera mobile. But not worth for even 13mb.

With fewer apps itself it hanged sometimes.",1
2399,Super!,"Very good phone.
Camera quality is not that good but a budget phone in this price range with good features.",5
2400,Excellent,"Getting snapdragon 680 processor in this price segment is like a dream come true.
Though, there are comprises with the camera and some features but considering the chip shortage and other problems its not a bad deal.
The performance is nice and most importantly if you are a custom rom lover then this will be the best phone for you among the currently available phones in this price segment.",5
2401,Value-for-money,"The device comes in a very good packaging.
It would've been better if they would've also included a soft case too.
Rear Camera is much better but front is okay.
Performance and display is much better.
Altogether will recommend to buy but if you're a camera enthusiast i suggest you stay away.",4
2402,Nice product,"All departments of this device is good except camera.
I think the camera of the phone that comes under 6k to 7k is also much better than this phone's camera. One more downside of this phone is ""charger"". This phone supports 18w charging but just 10w charger is given in the box. Except these two things almost every thing is good in this phone.",4
2403,Decent product,Performance is very good I love this mobile redmi 10 camara performance is good and bettary backup much better. Display is not good but average .,3
2404,Decent product,I expected more from this device but when I start using the phone it closes the apps automatically and hanging very much with this processor and camera is don't like 50 mp even the 16 mp is good but when we zoom it work other wise there is difference between 16 mp and 50 mp and the huge disadvantage is the phone inbox charger 10w it take lots of time to charge around 3 hours üò∞üò∞üò∞ my openion is don't buy this product because I generally use this device right now üôèüôèüôè,3

3418,Really Nice,"Got the item within 2 days. Writing this review after 2 cycle of battery usage. To be very honest, I bought this as my secondary phone for rough use along with my primary phone Iphone12.
Overall this phone is very good at this price range. With the branding of Samsung and if you like long battery phones like me, just go for it.
Only issue I and many users are having is with adds and auto Galaxy app installation. This does not come with a stock android.
Decent camera but it has macro mode.

Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones üéß as it has dolby atmos feature.",5

3425,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.,3
3426,Must buy!,"Very nice mobile , looks great , good bright AMOLED display , great battery life, and good camera .

3432,Very Good,"After a long time Samsung has launched a great phone with a good processor, excellent camera and display. The only thing lacking for me is the one ui core as the original version of one ui is more optimised and stable.

The battery life is average being it a 6000 mAh battery. Overall it's a value for money go for it.",4

I mean to say, when we buy new phones, what we are really looking for are upgrades (better camera, build, battery or processor, experience etc.) or some new things (change in OS, some UI to pure android etc.) Frankly, I'm quite amazed at how successful phone companies are in marketing products which are not so very different. All of this is to say that I didn't find any 'new' thing with this phone. Nothing stood out, I wasn't mesmer...

6031,Nice,"Cons: No Call recorder it informs while recording, Can't edit contacts after saving, some times lagging performance, not showing data tranfer rate in top, No file manager only Google files, no dedicated memory slot, No dedicated notes app..only suitable for elder people , what to do with stock Android? Without performance amoled waste.


Pros: decent camera, good battery, average performace",3
6032,A review after using more than a week.,"Super smooth, vibrant display, Good camera.
Those who are saying that phone is lagging, my advice to them is first use the device for a week, as phone is AI based and in beginning it learns your using pattern and after a week it became super smooth.",5
6033,Not good,"At this price point there are a lot of better options available. I bought it solely for the stock android experience and amoled display. But at the end of the day performance does matter. Switching to this one from Realme 3 pro feels like a major downgrade.

The biggest cons:-
1. Charging speed is so slow. It takes 2h 20m to fully charge from 15%. If you realise to charge your phone in the last half an hour, you won't be able to squeeze in much juice. You get a 20W charger but there is no fas...

6034,Great product,Hey guys I am writing this review after 4 month of ues..I purchased this phone on 6 December 21 on the launch of the day. Since then there is nothing like any problem.. great display quality. Great sound quality... Good battery backup.. only one thing i have noticed that some time while charging this phone it gets heated up.. remaining all are good.. overall rating would be 4.5 out of 5. If you are a Normal user.. don't like to play games and all.. you can go for it.,5

6037,Nice product,"Cameras are really worthless but display quality and dolby sound system make up for that shortcoming. Content watching is a treat on this phone. Day to day usage experience has been good so far. Nevertheless it's not a good option for heavy gamers as the processor is not a powerful one.

Switched from Redmi Note 8 pro to this phone because my old phone has radiation issues and I could feel the pain while using it. Till now I don't know how this phone will react, because Redmi started giving me problems after a year. Besides that I was satisfied with Redmi. Galaxy F22 is also a good choice.

Pros-
1. Good battery backup
2. Nice display
3. Interesting OS. Quite neat and quick. I was a fan of MI's OS. I found this ...

Digital well-being feature is awesome but my old phone automatically shutdown on the set time. This one feature is missing in this phone. Instead it makes the screen black and white. After all there is an option to turn this off.
When the phone is off there is no quick option to operate mobile and hence makes the mind to goto sleep.",4

Screen resolution is not industry standard so You'll have problems in standard apps like Hotstar in playing video because video will lag, no matter of your interest speed ( I have 150 Mbps connection) and tested on new phone so no overload of apps.

Rest is up to your decision üòÖ",1

8177,Classy product,A balanced best budget phone under 40k. Features loaded with vanilla OS experience. Decent camera. Very good display. Glitchy OS requires a bunch of future updates. The Glyph interface is a personal choice. Wireless charging works flawlessly. The battery lasts for a day with medium load usage. If you can invest in a new company and trust Carl Pei for supporting the devices then blindly go for it.,5

Short Review: If your main priorities are stock android, a good processor and a decent camera, go for it.

There are other brand phones which are cheaper than this and with better specs. But I chose Moto over them as Moto phones are more durable and the specs of this phone is not bad at all for this price.
My suggestion - Go with G40 6gb version instead of G60 as you won't find much of a difference between the photos taken by both the phones.",5

Camera:
After the update of 2.6 GB, believe me the camera quality of portrait shots are flagship like. All over camera 9 out of 10

Performance: Sometimes lags, For heavy users it will be a problem but in day to day task it handles easily.

Battery: battery performance is Good 7 out of 10

Display: 8.5 out of 10

Design: 9 out of 10

Sometimes it gets heated in direct sun light...

120hz and 60hz options give a very smooth experience.

Screen is too big to be handled by one hand.
Gaming is ok but not for professionals.
While changing themes, you can feel the phone stutter.

4. 5G can't be tested soon but seems comfortable connecting the wifi 5g band that's normally provided these days.
5. The features and customisation ...

9912,Brilliant,"The best thing about this phone is that it has pure stock Android without and bloatware. Has good display and perfect size. Performance is awesome with good battery backup gives screen time of 9-10hrs on full charge.

Stock pixel like UI bloatfree
Battery lasts more than 1 and half day in one charge
Display is immersive and great viewing angles

9915,Perfect product!,"Someone looking a clean , stock Android UI then go for the phone. Awesome camera, sleek and very well weighted phone. Load many MOTO features and The refresh rate should have been atleast 90hz but 60hz with bright amoled panel is a deal maker.",5
9916,Very Good,"Not that great in comparision to samsung M51 with regards to display and processor.

1. The round dial at this price is phenomenal. I'm always a fan of round dial watches.
2. The metal build feels premium.
3. Outdoor visibility of the screen is very good.
4. Activity tracking is quite accurate.
5. Battery backup is also very good. It lasts about 8-9 days on a single charge, as per my usage.

As of now, I couldn't find any cons of this smartwatch.

Conclusio...

Watch faces are limited...loading more time to download it
Camera control : we can use it by using camera in app only...(not phone inbuilt camera)

Price if bought under 3000

Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.

Battery life you can expect easy 1.5 to 2 day with casual use

Probably the best wear os watch at the price range rn",5
14983,Decent product,"While it is an excellent purchase, i am still growing into its features. I am using a non Samsung phone so I had to download a couple of apps to get the features working. The watch module is robust though it needs a protective case to retain its sheen. The UI is intuitive and slick with minimal stutters. The Fitness measuring parameters are industry standard. The biggest issue is the battery life which lasts 1.5 days even with minimal usage.

Pros:

1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

15865,Best in the market!,"I got it for 2K, in this budget this is the best watch.
I am writing this review after 7 day of use.
Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed.
Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc.
In 2000 this is the best watch.
It looks very premium.
Battery can last upto 4-5 days.",5
15866,Just wow!,"Awesome I suggest every one to buy this bez try new good battery life, good performance, looks classy",5
15867,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
15868,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

Like the review if you get helped out.",5

17983,Awesome,"It is the best smartwatch. Some of its pros are:
#It worth its cost.
#I like the wallpapers.
#Metallic built give it a premium look.
#Straps are very soft.
There are a few cons:
#Pixel density is less, that's why some wallpapers does not look good.
#Raise to wake is little slow but that's ok.
#It is a little heavy also.

Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.
Further the activity modes are different but the way it tracks a certain activity is same. For cycling for walking for running.. it shows the same UI
The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.

18013,Good,"Go for the watch if you want the looks only.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

Nothing is good but only for show off you can buy this product... Look is ok",2
18015,Horrible,"Not worth for money, it behaves like a roadside product. Not even water resistance as mentioned. Bought on Nov 2021 and in a month of time it is replaced for improper touch function. later it started rusting on the golden finish. As it is cosmetic it will not b covered under warranty. So now it's useless. But the marketing is based on the look and finish also. Looks great to get cheated like this",1

Pros:

Cons:

(1) Step counter is not working properly. If you travel somewhere on a vehicle it will increase the step count.

(2) whenever I keep my watch on table the heart rate sensor is turning on automatic. Hence draining battery.

(3) if you use the always on display it will consume like 30-40% battery in 3-4 hours.

What I didn't like most will be the screen - both quality as well as size. I bought this cos ot has BP, spo2 and heart rate monitors.",3
18370,Wonderful,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.

If you are in the market for an entry level fitness tracker, this will do just good!!",4

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.
1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

18378,Best in the market!,"I got it for 2K, in this budget this is the best watch.
I am writing this review after 7 day of use.
Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed.
Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc.
In 2000 this is the best watch.
It looks very premium.
Battery can last upto 4-5 days.",5

18380,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
18381,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.
Further the activity modes are different but the way it tracks a certain activity is same. For cycling for walking for running.. it shows the same UI
The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.

18733,Good,"Go for the watch if you want the looks only.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

3. ...

Nothing is good but only for show off you can buy this product... Look is ok",2
18735,Horrible,"Not worth for money, it behaves like a roadside product. Not even water resistance as mentioned. Bought on Nov 2021 and in a month of time it is replaced for improper touch function. later it started rusting on the golden finish. As it is cosmetic it will not b covered under warranty. So now it's useless. But the marketing is based on the look and finish also. Looks great to get cheated like this",1

Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.
Further the activity modes are different but the way it tracks a certain activity is same. For cycling for walking for running.. it shows the same UI
The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.

18853,Good,"Go for the watch if you want the looks only.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

* 42mm fits nicely especially if you have small wrists. The strap is comfortable. Decent build quality
*Good touch response & UI

Cons:
*Fair to say that the step counting feature is a joke. Had a OnePlus band before this & that was much more accurate. So, if fitness is important, stay away.
* With Always-on display feature turned on, battery needs to be recharged at the end of the day. 7 day battery life is a pipe dream

19534,Worth the money,"Reviewing product after using it for a week.

Battery life is good(charged it on 14th evening and currently it is on 50%(AOD off))
The step count is almost accurate
Heart rate, Spo2 monitor, and sport mode are also accurate.

It is a good and stylish watch along with good features in this price range.",4
19535,Just an average fitness watch,"It's not a smartwatch but a fitness watch which lacks accuracy for most of the health parameters.
Pros:
1. Display is top notch at this price point. AMOLED display is what differentiates it from others.
2. UI is fluent in transition and there is no stutter.
3. Build quality of watch is good. Watch strap is also of decent make.
4. Noisefit app is a decent application bringing you the entire data at one place.
5. With certain settings in the app, one can get good battery life.
Cons:

19536,Worth the money,Look wise it's ultimate.. Battery backup also good. I liked it's design n display. All the sensors are very accurate also sleep tracking works fine. And also I feel the dial is small.. Only thing is it has less sports mode.. Even if u have 60+ sports mode in other watches.. U won't use all off it. My suggestion is if u want fitness tracker.. Go for fitness bands.. Else if u want for looks and party wear watch u can go for this.. Looks super cool.,4

Edit: after using for exactly 2 months i am updating my reviews.
Pros:
(1) Nice display.


Cons:

(1) Step counter is not working properly. If you travel somewhere on a vehicle it will increase the step count.

(2) whenever I keep my watch on table the heart rate sensor is turning on automatic. Hence draining battery.

(3) if you use the always on display it will consume like 30-40% battery in 3-4 hours.

20524,Not good,Notifications are biggest issue. You have to do the setting again and again in the app. Even after that notification functionality doesn't work properly. No wonder why it's so cheap.

20527,Just wow!,"After 2 days of research, 100 of reviews and YouTube videos I finally got this with Republic Day offer for 2k. Mostly it is 2.5k. its worth the money.

But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.

Vibration was excellent in other models like Brio, but here vibration is not upto Mark. For find my device option phone is just vibrating, actually it would ring even if it is in silent mode, but it is not happening in this case.

Lot of things need to fix through updates. Hopefully Noise would do that.

Display wise brightest I have used. Touch sensitivity is awesome. It would recognise accident touches as well.

Vibration was excellent in other models like Brio, but here vibration is not upto Mark. For find my device option phone is just vibrating, actually it would ring even if it is in silent mode, but it is not happening in this case.

Lot of things need to fix through updates. Hopefully Noise would do that.

Display wise brightest I have used. Touch sensitivity is awesome. It would recognise accident touches as well.

22639,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5

23210,Worthful,Was looking for options in more popular brands and a local retailer suggested that BenQ is worthy one. Multiple input/output options makes it very convenient. Upto the expectation. Eye care technology is of great value.,5
23211,Good monitor!,"Really good monitor. I like the auto setting for brightness, called as eye care. It works well for me. The monitor briefly flickered two times, but I guess that could be due to cable being little loose in the laptop's end. I am not touching it anymore and it works fine. 24"" display is perfect, not too big or small. I use it for coding or when I need to open a large spredsheet, sometimes watch movies as well.

The color is crisp, a little brighter than my laptop. I usually have blue color fil...

23214,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5
23215,Really Nice,"The display is good, and I use to as my daily office monitor for work from home. The platform which I work on, the websites looks perfect and I do not have to squint my eyes like I used to do in my 14"" laptop provided by my office. Sure there is pixel bleeding from the edges, and pixels can be separated if you look very closely, but who will go that close to a monitor. One thing to note, this isn't suited for gaming, which demands high refresh rate and low response time, but for content consu...

It's the same panel if I'm not wrong, without the Brightness sensor. Which I found not to be of too much use. I always found it to be a bit too bright in the day, so I ended up tweaking the brightness myself. Save 1k and get the 2475h instead.

Panel is good. Colors are good. Eye strain is low. Stand is sturdy. Monitor looks good.

23409,Worth every penny,The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works.

24368,Wonderful,Overall a very good monitor. Just that it comes without a VGA cable you get only a HDMI cable with the power cable in the box. In case you are changing from a CRT monitor to a LCD you might need to purchase a VGA to VGA cable separately.(It should have come in the box seriously). IPS panel is the right opinion plus you can go all the way to 75htz quiet a good option for gamers on a budget.,4

24784,Does the job,"This comes with a 16a plug which won't fit in most of our normal sockets. It requires international 16a sockets. Considering the actual power consumption of the monitor, this is absolute overkill. Why does it comes with a 16a plug? To make our lives miserable? Maybe because this piece was never designed for Indian/international consumers. Which is still mediocre.



But the monitor is quite decent in itself. No complaints there.",3

25947,Wonderful,"This is a great buy in range of 15k, so if someone is plaining to buy monitor and if you have budget of 15k then go for it don't think much benq is better than all those well known player",5
25948,Wonderful,"Pros: Good picture quality, different modes for viewing movies, reading, surfing etc. Eye protection is Good. Height adjustments are nice and panel can also be rotated. There is audio in as well as out port.
Cons: The 1 watt speakers are useless. One more extra hdmi port and a usb port for charging if provided would have made this an excellent choice. Without them You need extra investment around 3k rs(for hdmi switch, speakers, usb charger etc.)",4
25949,Brilliant,"Trust me, One of the best monitors I have ever used. The Colors are super accurate and you will notice zero pixelation. I tried using with Mac and Windows OS both. If you need for your office work or watching movies or videos, go for it. The text is sharp and clear without any pixelation. The build quality is awesome. I tried DELL, LG and Samsung monitors as well, but BENQ is far better than them. Go for it.",5
25950,Great product,Superb monitor,5
25951,Pretty good,"Delivered within a day.Good product with height adjustable feature which helps with the ergonomics.
Customers beware that the product comes with a 16A 250V power cord cable which does not fit in the standard indian sockets.
Informing flipkart was of no use. Their customer care did not offer any help + never called back too.
Benq customer care on the other hand were super active. Quick response from benq customer care acknowledging their mistakes and sending the right power cable within 48 hrs.",4
25952,Did not meet expectations,"Never expected this from BenQ and Flipcart.
Screen display is flickering continuously.
I requested Flipcart to replace but not getting any proper response from them.
Also, not got any help from BenQ so far.
Pathetic service from Flipcart and sub standard product and poor customer service from BenQ.
I will recommend not to buy such electronic products from Flipcart as they are not bothered once product is delivered. Also, avoid BenQ monitors as they are not of good quality as screen has flick...
